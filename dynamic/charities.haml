      The Jamie Oliver Foundation is a registered charity (number 1094536) whose mission is to empower, educate and engage as many people as possible to love and enjoy good food.
    %p
      The charity funds the Fifteen Apprentice Programme, which takes on unemployed and under-qualified young people from the local area in each of the three Fifteen Restaurants (London, Amsterdam and Cornwall) and trains them to become qualified chefs.  Since 2002, more than 220 young people have graduated across all the restaurants, with some of them now running their own restaurants, starring on TV or working in top-class kitchens from London to New York to Sydney.
